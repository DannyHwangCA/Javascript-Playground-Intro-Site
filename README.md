Javascript Playground Site: https://dannyhwangca.herokuapp.com/

#Summary

Javascript Playground is an intro game site I created to showcase some Javascript animation, HTML5 Canvas, and Rails SPA skills. If a game ball character touches a game box object, the application directs to different sites (my personal page, linked in, and github). 

Skills used: Ruby on Rails (backend & asset pipline), Javascript, CSS, HTML5 canvas.

The animation was done using javascript intervals set to refresh the canvas every 20 seconds. 

Various components were created to be objects on the HTML 5 canvas and I also used various functions to script out the behaviors of each component.

The boxes link to my different sites (Personal Site, linkedin, Github) when touched by the "ball" character. 

Simply allow popups from the Heroku Site to be sent to my different sites.
