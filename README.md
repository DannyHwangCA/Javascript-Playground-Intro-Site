# Javascript-Playground-Intro-Site
Javascript Playground is an intro game site I created to showcase some Javascript animation, HTML5 Canvas, and Rails SPA skills. If a game ball character touches a game box object, the application directs to different sites (my personal page, linked in, and github). Skills used: Ruby on Rails (backend & asset pipline), Javascript, CSS, HTML5 canvas.
